# Certificate_Signing_Request_Parser
In this repository, I am working on processing CSR (Certificate Signing Request) files and displaying their information in a dashboard.  

The implementation uses the following technologies:  
- **Backend:** A Spring Boot application to process CSR files and provide data via APIs.  
- **Frontend:** A JavaScript-based application for visualizing the data in the dashboard.  

The goal is to create a user-friendly and efficient solution for processing and displaying CSR files.
